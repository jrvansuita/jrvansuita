Senior Android Engineer | Mentor | Tech Interview Coach | Founder at Neat

I'm a seasoned Android Mobile Engineer with over 12 years of experience crafting high-quality, scalable apps across industries including e-commerce, fintech, marketplaces, and entertainment. My expertise spans from Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Coroutines to clean architecture and modern Android best practices.

Since 2022, I've been teaching and mentoring Android developers, helping them grow from beginner to industry-ready. In 2024, I took on a formal mentorship role in selective training programs that prepare students for technical interviews and software engineering roles in the US market ‚Äî with a strong focus on algorithms, system design, and advanced Android topics.

I'm also the founder of Neat, a remote-first mobile consultancy I've reactivated to deliver top-notch Android solutions. I work closely with clients and mentees alike, combining technical depth with a passion for education, community, and career growth.
